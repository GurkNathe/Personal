        <span class="hello">HELLO</span> 
        I am a computer scientist with a passion for all things programming.
        The world of computers and computer science is facinating. From the 
        multitude of programming languages, and their purposes. To the software that people create
        using those languages. It is all facinating. The field that I've found
        most interest in, in recent times, is graph theory. More specifically, graph traversal
        and pathfinding algorithms, which I created a more education focused 
        simulation at 
        <a href="https://github.com/GurkNathe/Pathfinding-Algorithms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this github link</a> 
        to help myself learn more about them.
        Outside of my intrest for computer science, I have earned a Bachelor of
        Science in Computer Science from Central Washington University
        and have couple years of experience in the field,
        working on projects mainly relating to web development
        and data science.
        <br/><br/>
        Currently, I am not looking for employment. However, my expertise includes
        proficiency in a variety of programming languages,
        database technologies, and development frameworks. So, if you would like to
        collaborate with me on a project, I'd be more than happy to join in on it. You can contact me 
        through my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-krug-5a3088171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> LinkedIn</a> or
        <a href="mailto:ethan.c.krug@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Email</a>, preferably my email,
        as I will respond faster.
        <br /><br />
        Skillwise, I am proficient in Python, JavaScript, C#, and SQL as my day job 
        mainly uses these languages (if you want to count CSS and HTML, those are in there too). 
        I have done extensive work with Java, as most of my schooling was written in Java, 
        but I am by no means an expert in it. Similarily, I have used TypeScript to create websites, 
        however, I don't know all the ins and outs of the language, but enough to get around. 
        I have had past experience with C/C++, Google App Scripts, MATLAB, R, Bash/Shell, COBOL, 
        and a few other languages to a lesser degree, but I am by no means proficient in these 
        languages, even if I have written thousands of lines of code in them.
        <br /><br />
        Some of the tools that I've had extensive work with are mainly two frameworks: React and ASP.NET Core.
        <br /><br />
        React is the first real instance of me getting into programming, whether that be as a hobby
        or as a job. When I came across it, it was a very foreign thing to me, because up until that
        point, programming was just theoretical and what I had learned and done in school.
        <br /><br />
        I want to say, early 2019, I was first introduced to React when my best friend (my roommate at the time)
        wanted to make a website for some reason. I believe it had to do with our math classes, 
        but I don't remember the specifics. At the time, though, I wasn't too interested, but that
        was mainly due to external factors like depression, loneliness, and other personal
        issues that affected my state of being.
        <br /><br />
        Fast forward to late 2019, in my sophmore year of college, I once again come back to React
        in the form of React Native. Again, my best friend (not my roommate at the time) asked if 
        I wanted to be a part of a team creating a "study-buddy" app modeled after Tinder.
        I said yes, and joined the team. The app is called KiwiLink, and it was made for 
        University of Washington (UW) students so they could find people to study with. One of 
        the jokes in the group was that we were gonna sell the app to UW and "make our millions", 
        that obviously didn't happen. This was my first real look at React and a more organized or 
        commercial use of programming. Development on this app continues for a few months, and
        we ended up releasing it on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, however, it 
        is no longer being maintained.
        <br /><br />

        Fast forward again to late 2020, and I have transferred to Central Washington University.
        This was also the year that COVID started, which was a great time to transfer, what with
        being at a completely new school, and all the classes being online. Despite that, I did
        well, and my mental health improved during this period, which is a big plus.
        <br /><br />
        After transferring, I picked up React once more in early 2021. 
        I had a class that was a software development class, specifically focused on the practical 
        application of the Agile development method. Our team decided on creating a Google Maps-like
        application for hiking trails in Washington. This was when I started to really like programming,
        as weird as that may seem, given I was already a CompSci major at that point. I think the 
        thing that was most satisfy was building parts that would be used multiple times (components)
        in our application, and seeing everything come together like a LEGO set.
        <br /><br />
        In the summer of that year, I was reached out to by my best friend again, and he
        simply asked if I wanted a job lol. When I said yes, I was reached out to by an 
        organization called Academics Are Cool that wanted to remake their website.
        This was what I like to call a big learning experience. It was my first extensive
        dive into website building, integration of different systems, databases, UX/UI, and a lot more.
        I worked on this project for the whole summer, and was finished with the user-facing part
        of the website, so it was essentially functional. I worked on this website on and off after this,
        only finishing the rest of it in summer of 2022, after I had graduated. One thing I wanted to
        note for myself is the fact that server-side code is a thing, because I didn't know about that 
        when I started the website, and I only found out about it after I had completed the website once 
        I started to actually learn about software development in general. But yeah, this was a 
        doozy of a project, and it didn't help that the organization basically ghosted me but didn't
        even use the website I made. At least I got the experience though.
        <br /><br />
        Aside from that, I used react for a number of other projects like the previous version of
        this website and the web version of the Pathfinding Algorithms simulation, also another class where
        we built a Spotify playlist generator and statistics viewer.
        <br /><br />
        Finally, ASP.NET Core, this is what I mainly use at my job. I've created a fair amount of internal
        websites for the company I work for using the framework. I think it is a pretty solid framework, generally speaking,
        it's just annoying to get certain things working server-side, and it's made me appreciate
        non-framework websites so much so that I decided to rewrite my personal website (the website you're currently reading this on)
        without using a framework or external libraries.
        <br /><br />
        Other than these frameworks, I've mainly done theoretical computer science work using Java,
        and a lot of my work automation and data science related projects, I've used Python to handle them.
        I've also done some AI projects in Python and Java (moreso in Python), but I haven't gotten too
        deep in the weeds there. Mainly using tools and libraries like TensorFlow (Python) and Weka (Java) to create
        models that I've curated data for or used something like Kaggle.
