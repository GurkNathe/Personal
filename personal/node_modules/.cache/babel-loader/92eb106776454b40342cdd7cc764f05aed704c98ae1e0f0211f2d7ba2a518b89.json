I didn't do much with it then since I was\n                    in my freshman year of college and I had a lot going on class-wise.<br /><br />\n\n                    Come late 2019, I picked React back up when I was invited to\n                    work with a team creating an app using the React Native framework.\n                    After a few months of development, in early 2020, the project\n                    released an app called KiwiLink, which is a study-buddy\n                    app specifically for University of Washington (UW) students. The\n                    app was released on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store,\n                    however, it is no longer maintained.<br /><br />\n\n                    This is the time that COVID-19 started. I was in Seattle at the\n                    time and my family lived on the East side of Washington, over\n                    the Cascade Mountains that separated us. When the pandemic\n                    started, I moved back home to be closer to family in case I\n                    caught COVID. This also led to my transferring to\n                    Central Washington University starting fall of 2020.<br /><br />\n\n                    During this transition period for me, I felt stuck, being confined\n                    to my house due to the lockdowns, and the fear of getting COVID.\n                    It wasn't until early 2021 that I picked up React again.\n                    I had a class that was a software development class, specifically\n                    focused on the practical application of the Agile development method.\n                    For this class, I was part of a team that created a Google Maps-like\n                    React application for hiking trails in Washington State. This was\n                    where I found enjoyment and a greater interest in React.<br /><br />\n\n                    In the summer of 2021, I was reached out to, to see if I wanted\n                    to remake a website for an organization called\n                    Academics Are Cool. The main purpose of the organization\n                    was in facilitating math competitions within Washington State\n                    for elementary to high school students. I learned a lot while\n                    creating this website; more in-depth knowledge of React,\n                    database management, content management systems, user experience,\n                    web design, site security, user testing,\n                    client-contractor relations, and much more. I worked on this\n                    website for the entire summer, where I finished most of the\n                    website, with the exception of the administrator pages.<br /><br />\n\n                    I started my senior year at Central Washington University and \n                    continued to work on the website when I had time: in between \n                    classes after I was done with labs or assignments. I wouldn't \n                    completely finish the website until the summer of 2022, where it \n                    remained undeployed.<br /><br />\n\n                    Looking back at the code I wrote, and my development methods,\n                    I would say it is not my best work, however, I learned a lot. \n                    When I started the project I was essentially a beginner with React, \n                    and didn't know design paradigms in React, or virtually anything \n                    about web development. The only recent applicable experience I had \n                    was from the hiking website project from earlier in 2021. This also\n                    showed me how the need to stay updated with technologies is\n                    important. The experience I had with React Native, was minimally\n                    applicable due to the changes in React during the period of time\n                    I wasn't actively using it.<br /><br />\n\n                    Aside from the website for Academics Are Cool, in early 2022\n                    I was part of a team that created a web application using\n                    React that generated playlists based on user data (liked songs,\n                    user playlists, etc.), and displayed user statistics like\n                    most listened to artists, songs, genres, etc. I was able to\n                    apply my experience with React here, however, the project taught\n                    me a lesson in working with a team of varying skill levels. A few\n                    people on the team were experienced with React or web development,\n                    however, there were a number who weren't. The challenge came when\n                    having to follow the Agile method, where around half the group\n                    wasn't able to actively contribute to the project until at least\n                    the second sprint. It meant we had to do more work in the later\n                    sprints to make up for the lost amount of production in the\n                    earlier sprints.<br /><br />\n\n                    To add to that experience, a difference in coding style was\n                    a hurdle. We didn't have a style guide to follow, so everyone\n                    programmed in their own style, which made code readability\n                    difficult at times, and slowed down production.<br /><br />\n\n                    All in all, I think React is a framework that I feel strongly\n                    for and my journey with it showcases my experience with working\n                    with others and by myself, my ability to learn new\n                    technologies and concepts, as well as my understanding of\n                    software development.\n
