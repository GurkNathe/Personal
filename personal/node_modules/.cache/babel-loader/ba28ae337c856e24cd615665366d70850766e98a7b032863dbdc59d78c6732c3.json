A few\r\n                    people on the team were experienced with React or web development,\r\n                    however, there were a number who weren't. The challenge came when\r\n                    having to follow the Agile method, where around half the group\r\n                    wasn't able to actively contribute to the project until at least\r\n                    the second sprint. It meant we had to do more work in the later\r\n                    sprints to make up for the lost amount of production in the\r\n                    earlier sprints.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n                    To add to that experience, a difference in coding style was\r\n                    a hurdle. We didn't have a style guide to follow, so everyone\r\n                    programmed in their own style, which made code readability\r\n                    difficult at times, and slowed down production.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n                    All in all, I think React is a framework that I feel strongly\r\n                    for and my journey with it showcases my experience with working\r\n                    with others and by myself, my ability to learn new\r\n                    technologies and concepts, as well as my understanding of\r\n                    software development.<br /><br />\r\n                </span>\r\n            </Grid>\r\n            <Grid item container className=\"about-me-info\" direction=\"column\">\r\n                <h2
