The only recent applicable experience I had \r\n                            was from the hiking website project from earlier in 2021. This also\r\n                            showed me how the need to stay updated with technologies is\r\n                            important. The experience I had with React Native, was minimally\r\n                            applicable due to the changes in React during the period of time\r\n                            I wasn't actively using it.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n                            Aside from the website for Academics Are Cool, in early 2022\r\n                            I was part of a team that created a web application using\r\n                            React that generated playlists based on user data (liked songs,\r\n                            user playlists, etc.), and displayed user statistics like\r\n                            most listened to artists, songs, genres, etc. I was able to\r\n                            apply my experience with React here, however, the project taught\r\n                            me a lesson in working with a team of varying skill levels. A few\r\n                            people on the team were experienced with React or web development,\r\n                            however, there were a number who weren't. The challenge came when\r\n                            having to follow the Agile method, where around half the group\r\n                            wasn't able to actively contribute to the project until at least\r\n                            the second sprint. It meant we had to do more work in the later\r\n                            sprints to make up for the lost amount of production in the\r\n                            earlier sprints.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n                            To add to that experience, a difference in coding style was\r\n                            a hurdle. We didn't have a style guide to follow, so everyone\r\n                            programmed in their own style, which made code readability\r\n                            difficult at times, and slowed down production.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n                            All in all, I think React is a framework that I feel strongly\r\n                            for and my journey with it showcases my experience with working\r\n                            with others and by myself, my ability to learn new\r\n                            technologies and concepts, as well as my understanding of\r\n                            software development.\r\n                        </>\r\n                    </span><br /><br />\r\n                    <span className=\"info-section\">\r\n
