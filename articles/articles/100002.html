    Recently, I have been making life changes to improve my overall health: exercising, meditating, 
    eating better.
</p>
<p>
    In my pursuit to eat healthier, I came up with a breakfast which is both delicious and 
    incredibly nutritious.

<h2>
    Recipe
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 serving greek yogurt</li>
    <li>1 serving of fruit</li>
    <li>milk for consistency</li>
    <li>sugar free vanilla flavoring drops (optional)</li>
    <li>1 serving of oats/oats mix</li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Instructions
</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>In a bowl add your serving of greek yogurt.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Add your chosen serving of fruit. I usually add blueberries, raspberries, 
            strawberries, or bananas, but you can add any fruit you want.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Add milk for consistency. If you skip this step, the mix will be very clumpy and 
            potentially be dry. If you want, add a squeeze of vanilla flavoring in after pouring in the milk.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Add oats/oats mix (I get a muesli oats mix) and then stir the mixture until smooth 
            and well mixed.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
    This is an easy to make breakfast that takes me no more then 10 minutes, if I'm being slow. 
    It has good flavor and is nutrient rich. It is a great way to start your day. It is high in 
    clean protein and fiber, so if you need more of that in your diet, this is a good source.
