<h1>Analysis and Critique of Taylor's Constant Surveillance State</h1>
<h4>By Ethan Krug</h4>

<h2>Thesis</h2>
<p>
    In this article, I will be discussing and critiquing the surveillance state 
    envisioned by James Stacy Taylor in his article titled "In Praise of Big 
    Brother: Why We Should Learn to Stop Worrying and Love Government Surveillance". 
    In the article, Taylor proposes that we ought to welcome constant state 
    surveillance with open arms, and be supportive of such a system for the 
    benefits it brings. I argue that such a state is only feasible in an ideal 
    world, and once said system is tested under realistic conditions, it will 
    inevitably be abused. Once abused, such a system's benefits will become 
    irrelevant, as even those can be abused.
</p>
<h2>Taylor's State</h2>
<h3>Central Argument</h3>
<p>
    In Taylor's article, he argues "that rather than opposing such an expansion 
    of surveillance technology, its use should be encouraged—and not only in 
    the public realm. Indeed, the State should place all of its citizens under 
    surveillance at all times and in all places, including their offices, classrooms, 
    shops—and even their bedrooms" (Taylor 227). Taylor claims that such surveillance 
    is justified under the "widely held view that, in certain circumstances, it 
    is morally permissible for the State to secure information about past events" 
    (Taylor 228). He further elaborates that only in hindsight is it known whether 
    access to certain information is morally permissible. Using this, Taylor concludes 
    that since we only know if access to certain information is morally permitted 
    in hindsight, "then, the State is in principle morally permitted to place 
    its citizens under constant surveillance" (Taylor 228).
</p>
<p>
    Taylor further elaborates on his argument, and gives two premises for which 
    it is based off of. The first premise is: "if it is ever morally permissible 
    for the State to secure information about past events, then it is morally 
    permissible for it to do so through the use of surveillance devices" (Taylor 228). 
    The second premise is: "in some cases it is permissible for the State to 
    secure information about past events" (Taylor 228). Taylor explains that 
    for his proposed state, these two premises have to be accepted to be true 
    in order for said system to be morally permissible. From these premises, 
    Taylor ultimately concludes that "since it is potentially morally permissible 
    for agents of the State to secure information about events no matter when 
    or where they take place, it is morally permissible for the State to subject 
    its citizens to surveillance at all times and in all places, provided that 
    the information thus gathered was accessed only in the morally appropriate 
    circumstances" (Taylor 230). Prior to claiming this, Taylor gives the example 
    of the JFK assassination. The defenders of Lee Harvey Oswald argued that at 
    the time of the shooting, Oswald was not on site, but in fact "was standing 
    unarmed in the doorway of the Texas School Book Depository and produced a 
    photograph purporting to prove this" (Taylor 229). However, after investigating, 
    it was revealed that the person was actually a person named Billy Nolan 
    Lovelady. Taylor argues in this example that "it was morally permissible for 
    agents of the State to take steps to secure information about Lovelady's 
    whereabouts at the time in question to disprove Oswald's alibi—and this could 
    not have been predicted beforehand" (Taylor 230). Following this logic, since 
    it was morally permissible for the State to acquire information about Lovelady's 
    whereabouts in the past, this satisfies the premises of his argument. Since 
    there is precedent for where the premises of his argument are satisfied, 
    Taylor concludes that this justifies a State in surveilling it citizens at 
    all times, so long as the information collected by the surveillance is "accessed 
    only in the morally appropriate circumstances" (Taylor 230). This was a point 
    that Taylor wanted to drive with his argument. The argument was that the State 
    is morally permitted to surveil its citizens at all times in all places, not 
    that it is also morally permissible to access all the collected information 
    (Taylor 230). Additionally, the information that can be accessed is only 
    the minimum of what is morally permitted. Meaning, if only the sound from 
    a video recording is needed to prove something, then only the sound from 
    that recording can be accessed. Another clarification Taylor makes is in 
    how the surveillance takes place. Taylor clarifies that the State is not 
    morally permitted in entering your home and installing surveillance devices 
    if by doing so it would give the State access to more information than it 
    was morally permitted to access, unless the homeowner gives their explicit 
    consent to do so "(e.g., they would find out information about his domestic 
    habits and the interior of his home during the installation process)" (Taylor 231).
</p>
<h3>Ideal Scenario</h3>
<p>
    Looking at Taylor's proposed constant surveillance state, it is fair to 
    suppose such a state operates under ideal conditions. In said scenario, I 
    will assume that people will act as intended, as detailed by Taylor, and 
    assume they won't try to deviate from said intentions. In such a scenario, 
    I will detail how his proposed state will function and why it is beneficial.
</p>
<p>
    Surveillance devices will be installed throughout the country and used to 
    surveil the citizens. The surveillance will be installed in a morally permitted 
    fashion; there will be no invasion of someone's home/private property for 
    means of installing surveillance devices. For the recorded information, the 
    only information allowed to be accessed is only that which is morally legitimate 
    for the State's purpose (e.g., looking up a video to prove a crime). These 
    are the basic tenets of Taylor's proposed State.
</p>
<p>
    In such a state, there would be no need for witnesses to testify in the court 
    of law, as such witness testimony can be replaced by "information supplied 
    by surveillance devices" (Taylor 232). Taylor argues that this is a preferable 
    situation as, unlike witness testimony, the recordings won't be subject to 
    biases humans innately introduce. For example, there is a certain bias the 
    almost everyone experiences called "recall bias". "Recall bias is a type of 
    measurement bias, and can be a methodological issue in research involving 
    interviews or questionnaires. In this case, it could lead to misclassification 
    of various types of exposure" (Wikipedia, Recall Bias). This means that when 
    people are proctored about certain subjects, there is a possibility that they 
    incorrectly recall certain events, or include details that weren't there in 
    actuality. So, in Taylor's state, such biases would be eliminated and would 
    be replaced with an objective testimony.
</p>
<p>
    Another benefit of the state, would be a more equal and fair justice system. 
    Taylor gives the example of a rich defendant and a poor defendant that are 
    both wrongfully accused of a crime. In the case of the rich defendant, in 
    our current system (in the US), they can afford to hire a private investigator 
    to help prove their innocence. However, in the case of the poor defendant, 
    they don't have the ability to hire a private investigator. So, in this case, 
    the poor defendant is more likely to be wrongfully convicted, and the rich 
    defendant is more likely to be acquitted. This is where Taylor's state creates 
    a fairer and more equal justice system. In Taylor's state, it is argued that 
    the judge would be morally justified, and morally required, "in enabling the 
    defense to secure information that would prove [their] innocence, and that 
    would have been gathered by the State's surveillance devices" (Taylor 233). 
    This means, that both poor and rich defendants will have access to information 
    to help prove their innocence. This would significantly reduce the number of 
    wrongful convictions and create a more equitable justice system, since the 
    disparity of wrongful conviction rates between the wealthy and the poor would 
    be reduced (Taylor 233).
</p>
<p>
    Taylor's last designated benefit would be crime deterrence. His reasoning 
    follows the logic that since you (a citizen) won't know if you are being 
    watched or not, then you are more likely to not commit crime "for fear of 
    being caught in the act" (Taylor 233).
</p>
<h2>Criticism</h2>
<h3>Morally Permissible</h3>
<p>
    My biggest objection to Taylor's argument is his use of the phrase "morally 
    permissible". Nowhere in his argument does he go into detail about what 
    morally permissible means, exactly. This phrase is subjective and open to 
    interpretation, which can lead to potential abuses of his proposed system.
</p>
<p>
    To elaborate on how morally permissible can be interpreted differently, we 
    can look at surveillance in the United States of America (US). After the 
    9/11 attack occurred, the government hastily drafted and passed an act called 
    the Patriot Act. This act effectively enables the government to spy on Americans 
    without a warrant under the premise of suspected terrorism. At the time, 
    there was only one objector to the proposed act, and said act was considered 
    morally permissible by the government of the time due to great fear of terrorism. 
    This act later enabled the government justification to create systems like 
    PRISM, which spied on all of American internet and telephone communications 
    without a warrant, which is in violation of the fourth amendment (Wikipedia, 
    Prism). Additionally, some of the people that had access to PRISM used the 
    tool to access people's private images, and information, in clear violation 
    of the victims' privacy. At the time, the Patriot Act was considered morally 
    permissible, but it allowed for the violation of people's rights.
</p>
<p>
    The Patriot Act demonstrates my issue with Taylor's use of the term "morally 
    permissible" in determining how a government should act. The greatest fault 
    with said issue is that the one's defining what is "morally permissible" are 
    usually the State. Since the State is the one defining what is morally 
    permissible, it is not so far removed from reality to conclude that the 
    State will change the definition therein to suit their needs and motives, 
    not necessarily that which is in line with what is good for the citizens.
</p>
<h2>Abuses</h2>
<p>
    In response to the opposition that states there is potential for abuse, 
    Taylor delineates two different types of abuses and explains why said abuses 
    wouldn't be possible in his system, or how they are dealt with.
</p>
<h3>Major Abuses</h3>
<p>
    For the first category of abuse, he defines major abuses as "the State used 
    its power together with its improved surveillance capabilities to persecute 
    or oppress its citizens, either individually or as a whole" (Taylor 234-235). 
    Taylor rejects these abuses by saying that if a government weren't prone to 
    such abuses before the implementation of said system, then there is no reason 
    to believe they would commit such abuses once the system is in place. However, 
    I find this a naïve rejection of major abuses.
</p>
<p>
    In a realistic scenario, there is always the potential for things to not go 
    as expected. Take Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic as an example. Prior 
    to the pandemic, the country wasn't prone to major abuses of their citizens, 
    however, once the pandemic started, there were draconian restrictions imposed 
    unequally for the citizens of the country. The "elites" of the country were 
    free to move about the country and between states as they pleased, however, 
    many residents were denied entry to other states, and even denied entry to 
    their home state upon trying to return (Rozner, Australians Are Suffering 
    from Excessive COVID Lockdowns). Australia is an example of a State that 
    wasn't particularly malicious prior to an event, but became so after said 
    event occurred. While this isn't an exact comparison with Taylor's major 
    abuses rejection, it shows that a government can turn malicious, even without 
    a prior record of doing so.
</p>
<h3>Minor Abuses</h3>
<p>
    The second category of abuse defined are minor abuses. Taylor describes these 
    abuses as agents of the State acting independently "for their own nefarious 
    purposes, such as voyeurism or" mocking other people (235). To combat these 
    abuses, Taylor proposes certain safeguards be implemented to ensure that in 
    the case of inappropriate access to information, the bad actor in said scenario 
    is faced with "draconian penalties" for their actions. He also says that the 
    information should also be restricted to only a small number of permitted 
    people to further lessen the chance of abuse.
</p>
<p>
    To be anal-retentive about Taylor's wording, he never clarifies his ideas 
    about what safeguard to impose or what draconian penalties look like. He 
    does detail that if they are severe enough, they will serve as an effective 
    deterrent for minor abuses, however, he never details what said severe 
    penalties would be. I bring this up because there are certain penalties that 
    people aren't afraid of bearing. If the penalty was jail time, I don't think 
    it would be much of a deterrent for a large portion of the population. If 
    it was a penalty like the death penalty, then it would serve as a significant 
    deterrent, however, that would also introduce other ethical concerns. Even 
    then, there are still people that would be willing to risk their lives to 
    abuse the systems (e.g., clandestine agents).
</p>
<p>
    If we go to the ideal scenario that I talked about before, the proposal for 
    safeguards and penalties as deterrents would ward off minor abuses. However, 
    in a realistic scenario, people don't always behave as intended, so, as 
    mentioned before, the penalties and deterrents might not be enough to eliminate 
    minor abuses.
</p>
<p>
    Another point about the minor abuses goes back to the morally permissible 
    argument. The State is the one that is regulating all of this, and they are 
    the ones determining whether certain actions qualify for punishment or not. 
    It seems extremely naïve to expect the State to act with good intentions, 
    given a realistic scenario, or through a country like the US. From real-world 
    examples, it is readily seen that governments hold themselves to a different 
    set of standards to that of its citizens, by which I mean they believe they 
    are allowed to do things that would be deemed illegal if a private citizen 
    did. Given this, in a realistic scenario, there is no guarantee that minor 
    abuses won't cause harm, since the government can't be trusted to govern itself.
</p>
<h2>Bad Actors</h2>
<p>
    Moving past the State and into the general public, there is a risk posed by 
    potential bad actors, domestic and foreign.
</p>
<h3>Domestic Bad Actors</h3>
<p>
    With such a widespread surveillance network in Taylor's proposed state, it 
    would be easy to spy on someone if one had access to the surveillance devices 
    used by the State. This is where domestic bad actors come into play. More 
    specifically, hackers. Depending on the level of security such surveillance 
    devices enforce, it is feasible to assume that a hacker has the potential 
    to take control of a surveillance device and abuse the system for their own 
    nefarious purposes.
</p>
<p>
    In an ideal world, this would never be an issue. The surveillance devices 
    would have sufficient security such that no external force could access them, 
    thus eliminating the potential for hackers. However, this is only in ideal 
    circumstances. In realistic circumstances, it is reasonable to assume that 
    the security in such systems isn't perfect, and that at some point in time 
    a vulnerability will be discovered and taken advantage of for nefarious 
    purposes. This coincides with foreign bad actors.
</p>
<h3>Foreign Bad Actors</h3>
<p>
    Cyber warfare is a real threat to countries across the globe, and having a 
    State that has such a pervasive surveillance system leaves the State's populace 
    exposed to foreign entities. The same line of reasoning can be drawn for 
    foreign bad actors as was for domestic bad actors: in an ideal world, it 
    wouldn't be an issue, however, in a real-world scenario, it is reasonable 
    to assume foreign powers will find a vulnerability and use said weakness for 
    their own diabolical purposes.
</p>
<p>
    To go even further, if this country were at war with a foreign nation, the 
    surveillance network would pose a security risk due to the pervasiveness of
    said network. Furthermore, if the foreign nation wins the war, and is able to 
    successfully annex this country, there will be a likelihood for them to abuse
    the in-place surveillance state, due to their prior actions. Just to reiterate again,
    in an ideal world, there would be no war, so the risk proposed here would be
    irrelevant.
</p>
<h2>Beyond Crime</h2>
<p>
    Another issue I have with Taylor's imagined scenario is the lack of consideration 
    for the impact outside of criminal justice. One of my major concerns would 
    be for people's mental health.
</p>
<p>
    In an article titled "What are the Effects of Invasion of Privacy – Social 
    Media and Mental Health", Brett Friedman says "[t]he most significant impact 
    on mental health of this loss of privacy is the eroded trust in others. It 
    can be distrust of friends, family, the government and possibly even yourself, 
    and avoiding it isn't so easy when everyone else is under surveillance as 
    well. Eroding trust lays the groundwork for various other effects on an 
    individual's life." This captures my main thought regarding surveillance and 
    mental health. With this erosion of trust it can lead to more sever issues 
    like depression and anxiety disorders and potentially more mental health conditions.
</p>
<p>
    In regards to Taylor's proposed surveillance state, it matters not, for this 
    case, whether or not the information being recorded is ever going to be seen 
    by another person. Simply the act of recording a person, and the person 
    knowing they are being recorded, causes their mental state to be harmed, 
    whether that manifests in a lack of trust for others, or other psychological 
    conditions. As Brett Friedman says in his article, "[b]eing constantly watched 
    makes it normal to worry about if your humor is too dark, your political 
    stances too radical, your private web searches too controversial and your 
    personality too out there. The old bounds of behavior shrink, and that leaves 
    many more people with anxiety who are less sure if their worries are real 
    or all in their heads."
</p>
<p>
    In Taylor's ideal world, people wouldn't have these issues, as they would 
    accept the surveillance without the fear of being recorded, since it's a 
    good thing, or their inner thoughts shared with others, since no one will 
    ever hear/see them unless morally permissible. However, in a real-world 
    scenario it is the complete opposite. With all the arguments above combined, 
    it would be rational to conclude people would be anxious and stress over 
    their thoughts in private since there is potential for them to be exposed, 
    and as Friedman said, people would be in a constant state of anxiety stressing 
    over things we normally wouldn't. In this state with no confidentiality, 
    there would be a significant epidemic of mental health problems.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    To summarize my writings, Taylor's constant surveillance state has its benefits, 
    mainly in criminal/legal justice. However, such benefits can only be realized 
    in an ideal world due to realistic volatility and human erraticism. Since 
    the benefits are only available without harm in an ideal world, any real-world 
    implementation of a constant surveillance state will naturally be harmful, 
    in that, the abuses of such a state will outweigh the benefits of said state. 
    Like what happened with PRISM, such a surveillance tool would be subject to 
    similar, if not more egregious abuses. Bad Actors be they of the State, 
    domestic, or foreign have the potential to compromise Taylor's State, and 
    the State could claim they acted in a morally permissible manner since they 
    are the ones defining the terms. Furthermore, this state would cause harm 
    outside of criminal justice, where it impacts the population's mental health, 
    with the strain of no privacy. Thus, I conclude that Taylor's state is 
    unrealistic, and would have the potential for greater abuses and harm even 
    when there are obvious benefits in the criminal justice sector.
