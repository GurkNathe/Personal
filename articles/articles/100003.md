# Mobile Phone Privacy

By Ethan Krug

---

In today's modern world, where many of us spend a large portion of our time in the digital world, it doesn't come as a shock to many when they learn about how they are being surveilled and tracked in the digital world. A saying has developed from this digital age about free-to-use software: "if you're not paying for the product, you are the product." This is a saying that is relevant to most people. A general user of the internet will use Google Chrome and the Google search engine, two free to use pieces of software. They most likely use Gmail or Outlook for their email. They use YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, et cetera et cetera. The point being, almost all of these "free-to-use" software are actually not free-to-use. You don't pay with money, but you pay with your information. Name, age, race, location, posts, likes, dislikes, anyway you interact with these software is an avenue that information about you can be extracted and sold to the highest bidder.

For some people, this isn't an issue. There are many that are fine with it and actually encourage it since being integrated in this technological ecosystem can increase productivity among other things. However, this also means letting these companies know everything about you. 

If you don't want your information to be compromised while using your phone, or having it shared with all these corporate entities, what can you do?

## Regaining Privacy

### Android

The first step is to switch to Android if you are using Apple. For one, Apple is incredibly invasive with their iOS. The thing that stands out most to me is the file scanning that occurs on Apple devices. Apple phones routinely [scan media files client side](https://sneak.berlin/20230115/macos-scans-your-local-files-now/), which is reported to primarily detect CSAM and alert authorities, which is a good purpose. However, what about every other file that isn't CSAM? What about your private pictures that you would only show to your partner? Well, now Apple can look at them in all their glory.

Now, with Android it is similar if you only stick with the general products. The different Android flavors that are available on the market are going to primarily be the Google equivalent to what Apple does. However, due to Android being open source, it has allowed more freedom in choice.

### Custom ROM

The first step to regaining privacy while using your phone is to start using a custom ROM of Android. Preferably one of the more privacy focused ROMs like GrapheneOS or CalyxOS. The only issue (or not) with these two, is that they are primarily or only available for the Google Pixel phones, ironically. Preferably, I would go with GrapheneOS, however CalyxOS is just as good or better for some people. The reason to use a custom ROM is self evident when you know more about Android. Android is a Google owned project, much of the generic or basic functionalities of the Android OS comes with Google applications pre-installed and you can't uninstall them or stop some of them from running in the background. So, you are virtually unable to stop Google from effectively spying on you and collecting your data. There is a way to remove these applications through a third party tool with your device connected to your computer, but if you don't know what you're doing you can majorly screw up your phone. This is where custom ROMs come in, I'll specifically talk about GrapheneOS. GrapheneOS is a ROM that "De-Googles" your phone and adds privacy and security features on top of that. 

Now, you may be thinking that this seems all too complex and a beginner could never do this. However, GrapheneOS has made it quite simple to install and get working. [Here](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=L1KZWjZVnAw) is a tutorial that details the process of how to do so. In the video, he mentions that you need to get a phone that is "OEM unlocked". Depending on how you acquired the phone, you may not need to check ahead of time. OEM unlocking means "Original Equipment Manufacturer" unlocking, essentially it allows you to manually unlock the boot loader of your phone, which will allow you to use custom ROMs. This sounds complicated again, but all it is, is changing a settings option from off to on. 

After you have installed GrapheneOS and followed the proper procedures, your phone will, out-of-the-box, be significantly more private than before.

### Applications

One of the biggest things you can do, even without having to switch to a different device or OS, is using different apps.

Many people simply use the apps that come preinstalled on their device and don't consider alternatives, unless an issue like the app being slow occurs.

The first step is to stop using these preinstalled applications, like the Google applications. That means no Chrome, no YouTube, Gmail, Google Drive, etc. There are a plethora of alternative options that center around privacy that offer the same or similar experience as the Google applications.

If you don't want to read through everything, [privacytools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/) is probably the best source when it comes to choosing which apps to download.

#### App Stores

The first thing to change is how you download apps. Just like with every Google product, the Google Play Store is subject to their all-seeing eye. To combat this, you will want to download an APK, which can be thought of as essentially a third-party application, the [F-Droid store](https://f-droid.org/). Throughout the F-Droid store, you can find many great FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) applications. However, it is limited to such, so applications that are closed source (e.g., Snapchat, Instagram) aren't available. But — not to fear — there is another app store that can be downloaded that directly replaced Google Play Store: [Aurora Store](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.store/). Aurora Store functions as a client of the Play Store, but with increased privacy. You can still download all your same applications as before, just through a different interface. Additionally, you can open Google Play Store links with Aurora Store.

Now that you have Aurora Store and F-Droid, you can start replacing other apps.

#### Browsers

One of the most important applications on most devices nowadays is a means of browsing the internet. For Android there are a number of options to choose from.

One thing to note before continuing, browsers that aren't Chromium-based for Android are generally going to be worse options. Additionally, one of the touted browsers for privacy on the internet, TOR, isn't as private as most might think: [source](https://restoreprivacy.com/TOR/#:~:text=1.%20Tor%20is%20compromised%20(and%20not%20anonymous)). Furthermore, TOR is incredibly slow due how it is structured. So, as an everyday web browser, it isn't recommended.

For Android, the number one recommended browser is [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/#:~:text=donations%20address%3A%200x5d392F8FBf3465afe05B1Adc575e248D33B891F6-,Download%20Bromite,-Current%20Bromite%20stable). It is based on Chromium, the software behind Google Chrome, so the interface will be familiar to people switching over from there. Additionally, it comes hardened out-of-the-box, so you can feel more secure that you aren't being tracked at all times.

You can also use browsers like [Brave](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brave.browser&hl=nl&gl=US) and [DuckDuckGo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android). 

To go along with the browser, you should stop using Google Search. [Here](https://www.privacytools.io/private-search) is a list of private web search engines for you to choose from. I usually use DuckDuckGo, however you may prefer another like Startpage or MetaGer.

#### Messaging

If you are concerned about privacy, secure and private messaging should be a top priority. Thankfully there are many options available.

Some things to note about secure and private messaging. One, to obtain private messaging, your messages have to be encrypted. Which means, the receiver has to be able to decrypt the message to read it. Meaning, if you are not using the same messaging application as your receiver, you either won't be able to send them a message using the app, or it will not be private. Two, try and use a messaging service with post-quantum encryption standards. While this isn't the biggest issue right now, companies and governments around the world have been storing encrypted data for when the days quantum computers become powerful enough that they can use them to crack the encryption previously used, and decrypt the data. At that time, all the previously private messages will become public, which is the opposite of what we want.

If you can convince your recipients to download the same apps as you [this list](https://www.privacytools.io/privacy-messaging) covers the best options for you. Signal and Session are the two messaging apps that have worked best for me. However, if you can't get your receiver to use your flavor of messaging app, what's the best option?

If you can't use the same application, your messages aren't going to be encrypted. While it will be less private, the best option in my opinion is the SMS Messenger from the [Simple Mobile Tools collection](https://www.simplemobiletools.com/). It has no fluff, no flavor of spyware built in, it's just that, a simple SMS messenger.

#### Email

Another means of messaging, just slightly different, is email. This one is a little more challenging, in my opinion, in finding a wide range of user-friendly applications.

The apps in this category also depend on what email provider you are using, which complicates the matter even further. Depending on how your email is set up, all to none of the apps will work.

The first app that I recommend is [K-9 Mail](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.fsck.k9/). K-9 mail is what I currently use, and it offers a fairly simple setup for using it. Additionally, you can use multiple emails for different providers with it. The UI is simple and neat, and most people could pick it up quickly and start using is right away.

[FairEmail](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/eu.faircode.email/) is the second I would suggest. I personally don't like the UI of the app, but feature-wise it is about equal with K-9 Mail. The only downside that I had was in setting up the app. It may have been my misunderstanding of how to proceed, but it felt more cumbersome to use than K-9 Mail.

Other than these two, there are specific providers which have great apps. Tutanota and Proton Mail are a couple. Tutanota is centered around your privacy and takes steps to make sure user's information is private and secure. Proton Mail is relatively similar, however many people have been skeptical of the service, but there haven't been any major issues to note, that I know of, and many of the features they offer are better than some paid services, so you be the judge.

#### Utility Apps

Utility apps are another big group of applications that may get overlooked when talking about privacy. Your camera app, picture gallery, file explorer, contacts, phone app, etc.

Most of these have the same issues as every other app, tracking and extracting your data.

In the Messaging section I talked about the SMS Messenger from the Simple Mobile Tools collection. This collection of applications are probably the best replacements for your utility apps. 

While you might loose certain functionality, specifically with the camera, or cloud functionality, there will be little to no difference when switching over.

Another Easter-egg with these apps is that they are on the F-Droid store, even the Pro version. And every app that is on the F-Droid store is free to download. So, you don't have to pay to use the Pro version of the apps. There is an app by the same author called "Thank You", and it essentially allows you to enable more customization features, like changing the apps' colors.

Other utilities like your compass or GPS can be changed as well. There are a number of these apps and you should just search for what works best for you. I use [this compass app](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.bobek.compass/) and [MapQuest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapquest.android.ace) for these two. However, MapQuest does have 2 known trackers, so an alternative I'd recommend is [OsmAnd](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.osmand.plus). The issue I have with OsmAnd is when you want to use a specific address. In many cases, I wasn't able to find the correct location using OsmAnd, and in a few cases, it took me to a completely different area. But, all things considered, MapQuest and OsmAnd are the top two GPS apps for me. 

Another utility is your keyboard. One thing you might not realize is that your built-in keyboard is key logging everything you type, so for someone privacy conscious, this is something to change.

Simple Mobile Tools has a keyboard that you can use, which works just fine. However, I prefer [OpenBoard](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.dslul.openboard.inputmethod.latin). They layout simply suits me better. With this app, F-Droid has [a lot of options](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=keyboard&page=1&lang=en).

The last of the utility apps I can think of are password managers. The only one that I would recommend is [KeePassDX](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.kunzisoft.keepass.libre/). One of the biggest issues with password managers nowadays is that a lot of them are saved to a cloud service, which means, if the service is attacked, your login credentials are compromised. So one of the key features when looking for a password manager is to make sure it is **offline**. This may cause an inconvenience when switching between devices, sure, but it is way safer. KeePassDX, in specific, is great due to how feature rich it is. Organizing passwords and information is quite easy with KeePassDX, there's a built-in password generator, it supports key files and hardware keys. Key files are essentially a second password in the form of a file, and a hardware key is just that, a physical device that is used as a key to the password manager. I use YubiKey for mine, however there are a number on the market. Another interesting feature is the ability to have multiple password databases, meaning you can have separate databases depending on the passwords you want to store and each database can have a different password/set of credentials to access it. The last thing is when accessing an entry: there is the ability to auto-fill logins in apps or in the browser, additionally there is a timed copy for credentials (i.e., you have a certain amount of time before your copied credentials are cleared from the clipboard and you have to copy them again). However, something that I noticed, is the copied content can still be accessed if you tap on the "clipboard" option when you long press.

Other than these utilities, there are probably a number I am forgetting or simply don't use. In this way, exploring for yourself, looking through what F-Droid offers, can help you discover new apps.

#### App Launcher

Another thing that might not come to mind is the App Launcher. For Samsung users, you may have seen an app in settings called One UI Home, this is your App Launcher from Samsung. 

You can change this launcher as well, since you're effectively being key logged or "screen logged" by using the One UI Home. 

For this it basically comes down to aesthetic preference. Simple Mobile Tools has their own app launcher, but it is too simple for my liking. Personally, I use [Lawnchair](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ch.deletescape.lawnchair.plah/), but it all comes down to preferences and what your goal is.

#### VPN

One of the best ways you can secure yourself and gain privacy on the internet is to use a VPN. However, not every VPN was created equal.

I would recommend using the [Mullvad VPN](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.mullvad.mullvadvpn/). Like most VPN services, it is a paid service. The price for Mullvad VPN is €5/month or $5.43/month, which is quite affordable. Mullvad VPN has a track record of being transparent with how they handle user data and privacy. Their main point is that they will keep your information private within the bounds of the law. Meaning, if a warrant for your information is ordered, there's nothing they can do, but other than that, they won't give your information to anyone for any reason. 

There is [ProtonVPN](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ch.protonvpn.android), which offers a free tier for their service, however whether privacy is guaranteed, I'm not too sure. On their page they say: "We do not record your browsing history; We do not display privacy-invading ads; We do not sell your data to third parties; We do not limit how much you can download". However, the amount of trust your willing to put into this is up to you. As a side note, this is the same company that is responsible for Proton Mail that I talked about in the Email section.

### Going Forward

This is a good start for privacy on Android. There are some things I didn't cover, like social media alternatives, but this post is already long enough. I strongly suggest looking at [Privacy Tools](https://www.privacytools.io/) to search for more information, and to search other sources for their recommendations.
