<h1>Mobile Phone Privacy</h1>
<p>By Ethan Krug</p>
<hr>
<p>
    In today's modern world, where many of us spend a large portion of our 
    time in the digital world, it doesn't come as a shock to many when they learn 
    about how they are being surveilled and tracked in the digital world. A saying 
    has developed from this digital age about free-to-use software: "if you're not 
    paying for the product, you are the product." This is a saying that is relevant 
    to most people. A general user of the internet will use Google Chrome and the 
    Google search engine, two free to use pieces of software. They most likely use 
    Gmail or Outlook for their email. They use YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, 
    et cetera et cetera. The point being, almost all of these "free-to-use" software 
    are actually not free-to-use. You don't pay with money, but you pay with your 
    information. Name, age, race, location, posts, likes, dislikes, anyway you 
    interact with these software is an avenue that information about you can be 
    extracted and sold to the highest bidder.
</p>
<p>
    For some people, this isn't an issue. There are many that are fine with it 
    and actually encourage it since being integrated in this technological ecosystem 
    can increase productivity among other things. However, this also means letting 
    these companies know everything about you.
</p>
<p>
    If you don't want your information to be compromised while using your phone, 
    or having it shared with all these corporate entities, what can you do?
</p>
<h2>Regaining Privacy</h2>
<h3>Android</h3>
<p>
    The first step is to switch to Android if you are using Apple. For one, Apple 
    is incredibly invasive with their iOS. The thing that stands out most to me is 
    the file scanning that occurs on Apple devices. Apple phones routinely 
    <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20230115/macos-scans-your-local-files-now/">
        scan media files client side
    </a>, 
    which is reported to primarily detect CSAM and alert authorities, which is a 
    good purpose. However, what about every other file that isn't CSAM? What about 
    your private pictures that you would only show to your partner? Well, now 
    Apple can look at them in all their glory.
</p>
<p>
    Now, with Android it is similar if you only stick with the general products. 
    The different Android flavors that are available on the market are going to 
    primarily be the Google equivalent to what Apple does. However, due to Android 
    being open source, it has allowed more freedom in choice.
</p>
<h3>Custom ROM</h3>
<p>
    The first step to regaining privacy while using your phone is to start 
    using a custom ROM of Android. Preferably one of the more privacy focused 
    ROMs like GrapheneOS or CalyxOS. The only issue (or not) with these two, 
    is that they are primarily or only available for the Google Pixel phones, 
    ironically. Preferably, I would go with GrapheneOS, however CalyxOS is just 
    as good or better for some people. The reason to use a custom ROM is self 
    evident when you know more about Android. Android is a Google owned project, 
    much of the generic or basic functionalities of the Android OS comes with 
    Google applications pre-installed and you can't uninstall them or stop some 
    of them from running in the background. So, you are virtually unable to stop 
    Google from effectively spying on you and collecting your data. There is a 
    way to remove these applications through a third party tool with your device 
    connected to your computer, but if you don't know what you're doing you can 
    majorly screw up your phone. This is where custom ROMs come in, I'll 
    specifically talk about GrapheneOS. GrapheneOS is a ROM that "De-Googles" 
    your phone and adds privacy and security features on top of that.
</p>
<p>
    Now, you may be thinking that this seems all too complex and a beginner could 
    never do this. However, GrapheneOS has made it quite simple to install and 
    get working. <a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=L1KZWjZVnAw">Here</a> is a 
    tutorial that details the process of how to do so. In the video, he mentions 
    that you need to get a phone that is "OEM unlocked". Depending on how you 
    acquired the phone, you may not need to check ahead of time. OEM unlocking 
    means "Original Equipment Manufacturer" unlocking, essentially it allows you 
    to manually unlock the boot loader of your phone, which will allow you to use 
    custom ROMs. This sounds complicated again, but all it is, is changing a 
    settings option from off to on.
</p>
<p>
    After you have installed GrapheneOS and followed the proper procedures, your 
    phone will, out-of-the-box, be significantly more private than before.
</p>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>
    One of the biggest things you can do, even without having to switch to a 
    different device or OS, is using different apps.
</p>
<p>
    Many people simply use the apps that come preinstalled on their device and 
    don't consider alternatives, unless an issue like the app being slow occurs.
</p>
<p>
    The first step is to stop using these preinstalled applications, like the 
    Google applications. That means no Chrome, no YouTube, Gmail, Google Drive, etc. 
    There are a plethora of alternative options that center around privacy that 
    offer the same or similar experience as the Google applications.
</p>
<p>
    If you don't want to read through everything, 
    <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/">privacytools.io</a> is probably the best 
    source when it comes to choosing which apps to download.
</p>
<h4>App Stores</h4>
<p>
    The first thing to change is how you download apps. Just like with every 
    Google product, the Google Play Store is subject to their all-seeing eye. To 
    combat this, you will want to download an APK, which can be thought of as 
    essentially a third-party application, the 
    <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid store</a>. Throughout the F-Droid store, 
    you can find many great FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) applications. 
    However, it is limited to such, so applications that are closed source 
    (e.g., Snapchat, Instagram) aren't available. But — not to fear — there is 
    another app store that can be downloaded that directly replaced Google Play Store: 
    <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.store/">Aurora Store</a>. 
    Aurora Store functions as a client of the Play Store, but with increased privacy. 
    You can still download all your same applications as before, just through a 
    different interface. Additionally, you can open Google Play Store links with 
    Aurora Store.
</p>
<p>
    Now that you have Aurora Store and F-Droid, you can start replacing other apps.
</p>
<h4>Browsers</h4>
<p>
    One of the most important applications on most devices nowadays is a means 
    of browsing the internet. For Android there are a number of options to 
    choose from.
</p>
<p>
    One thing to note before continuing, one of the 
    touted browsers for privacy on the internet, TOR, isn't as private as most 
    might think: 
    <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/TOR/#:~:text=1.%20Tor%20is%20compromised%20(and%20not%20anonymous)">
        source
    </a>. 
    Furthermore, TOR is incredibly slow due how it is structured. So, as an 
    everyday web browser, it isn't recommended. However, you can use it. I'd
    recommend reading the article I linked above about TOR before you use it.
</p>
<p>
    For Android, my number one recommended browser is 
    <a href="https://www.bromite.org/#:~:text=donations%20address%3A%200x5d392F8FBf3465afe05B1Adc575e248D33B891F6-,Download%20Bromite,-Current%20Bromite%20stable">Bromite</a>. 
    It is based on Chromium, the software behind Google Chrome, so the interface 
    will be familiar to people switching over from there. Additionally, it comes 
    hardened out-of-the-box, so you can feel more secure that you aren't being 
    tracked at all times. However, as of writing this, Bromite is currently many
    months behind the release for the upstream code of Chromium. It doesn't 
    necessarily mean Bromite is less secure, it just increases the risk in usage 
    if an exploit is found for the version of Chromium it is based on.
</p>
<p>
    If you're looking for a non-Chormium based browser for Android, my recommendation
    would be the <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/us.spotco.fennec_dos/">Mull browser</a>.
    As their description states: "This is a privacy oriented and deblobbed web browser 
    based on Mozilla technology. It enables many features upstreamed by the Tor 
    Uplift project using preferences from the arkenfox-user.js project." What this means
    is that, like Bromite, Mull comes hardened out of the box. One of the best features 
    of the browser (like most mobile Firefox based browsers) is add-ons. 
    You can use add-ons like uBlock Origin, which Mull recommends, as well as add-ons 
    like NoScript, Privacy Badger, ClearURLs, and Decentraleyes, among others. 
</p>
<p>
    If you don't like either of those browsers, here're a few more:  
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brave.browser&amp;hl=nl&amp;gl=US">Brave</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/fork-maintainers/iceraven-browser/releases">Iceraven</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.duckduckgo.mobile.android/">DuckDuckGo</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    To go along with the browser, you should stop using Google Search. As with every 
    Google product, if it's free your data is the price you pay, and if it's not free, 
    you're still paying with your data. So, ditch it as soon as possible. Other popular
    search engines like Bing and Yahoo are equally as bad as Google. So, 
    <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/private-search">here</a> is a list of private 
    web search engines for you to choose from. I usually use DuckDuckGo, however you may 
    prefer another like Startpage or MetaGer. I've also used Searx in the past, however,
    it offers less content compared to most other search engines, and can be dependant 
    on the host of the Searx site, since Searx is a self-hosted. 
</p>
<h4>Messaging</h4>
<p>
    If you are concerned about privacy, secure and private messaging should be a 
    top priority. Thankfully there are many options available.
</p>
<p>
    Some things to note about secure and private messaging. One, to obtain private 
    messaging, your messages have to be encrypted. Which means, the receiver has to be 
    able to decrypt the message to read it. Meaning, if you are not using the same 
    messaging application as your receiver, you either won't be able to send them a 
    message using the app, or it will not be private. Two, try and use a messaging service 
    with post-quantum encryption standards. While this isn't the biggest issue right now, 
    companies and governments around the world have been storing encrypted data for when 
    the days quantum computers become powerful enough that they can use them to crack the 
    encryption previously used, and decrypt the data. At that time, all the previously 
    private messages will become public, which is the opposite of what we want.
</p>
<p>
    If you can convince your recipients to download the same apps as you 
    <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/privacy-messaging">this list</a> covers the 
    best options for you. Signal and Session are the two messaging apps that have worked 
    best for me. Of the two, I would choose Signal for a couple reasons. One, they now
    use post-quantum encryption in their messaging protocal. Two, they don't store any
    of your data. The only information they have about you is date of account creation,
    and data of last connection to their servers; no messages, groups, contacts, etc. 
    are stored by them. For these main reasons, I recommend Signal, along with it being
    very user-friendly. However, if you can't get your receiver to use your flavor of 
    messaging app, what's the best option?
</p>
<p>
    If you can't use the same application, your messages aren't going to be encrypted. 
    While it will be less private, the best option in my opinion is the SMS Messenger 
    from the <a href="https://www.simplemobiletools.com/">Simple Mobile Tools collection</a>. 
    It has no fluff, no flavor of spyware built in, it's just that, a simple SMS messenger. 
    However, I've found that it doesn't do well at reading old messages. So, messages older
    than a certain amount of time won't be visible, save for some images and jumbled messages.
</p>
<p>
    Another messaging app that I found in the same category is QKSMS. Unlike SMS Messenger, 
    historical messages are displayed properly, and the UI uses a "modern design". There are 
    additional quality of life features like backup and restoring, scheduling messages, and 
    archiving messages. You can download QKSMS from <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.moez.QKSMS/">F-Droid</a>
    and from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moez.QKSMS">Google Play Store</a>.
    However, a downside that I found is the inability to send media without the image quality
    degrading. SMS Messenger performed fine in this regard.
</p>
<h4>Email</h4>
<p>
    Another means of messaging, just slightly different, is email. This one is a 
    little more challenging, in my opinion, in finding a wide range of user-friendly 
    applications.
</p>
<p>
    The apps in this category also depend on what email provider you are using, 
    which complicates the matter even further. Depending on how your email is set 
    up, all to none of the apps will work.
</p>
<p>
    The first app that I recommend is 
    <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.fsck.k9/">K-9 Mail</a>. K-9 mail is 
    what I currently use, and it offers a fairly simple setup for using it. 
    Additionally, you can use multiple emails for different providers with it. 
    The UI is simple and neat, and most people could pick it up quickly and 
    start using is right away.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/eu.faircode.email/">FairEmail</a> is 
    the second I would suggest. I personally don't like the UI of the app, but 
    feature-wise it is about equal with K-9 Mail. The only downside that I had was 
    in setting up the app. It may have been my misunderstanding of how to proceed, 
    but it felt more cumbersome to use than K-9 Mail.
</p>
<p>
    Other than these two, there are specific providers which have great apps. 
    Tutanota and Proton Mail are a couple. Tutanota is centered around your privacy 
    and takes steps to make sure user's information is private and secure. Proton Mail 
    is relatively similar, however many people have been skeptical of the service, 
    but there haven't been any major issues to note, that I know of, and many of the 
    features they offer are better than some paid services, so you be the judge.
</p>
<h4>Utility Apps</h4>
<p>
    Utility apps are another big group of applications that may get overlooked when 
    talking about privacy. Your camera app, picture gallery, file explorer, contacts, 
    phone app, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Most of these have the same issues as every other app, tracking and extracting 
    your data.
</p>
<p>
    In the Messaging section I talked about the SMS Messenger from the Simple Mobile 
    Tools collection. This collection of applications are probably the best 
    replacements for your utility apps.
</p>
<p>
    While you might loose certain functionality, specifically with the camera, or 
    cloud functionality, there will be little to no difference when switching over.
</p>
<p>
    Another Easter-egg with these apps is that they are on the F-Droid store, even 
    the Pro version. And every app that is on the F-Droid store is free to download. 
    So, you don't have to pay to use the Pro version of the apps. There is an app by 
    the same author called "Thank You", and it essentially allows you to enable 
    more customization features, like changing the apps' colors.
</p>
<p>
    Other utilities like your compass or GPS can be changed as well. There are a 
    number of these apps and you should just search for what works best for you. 
    I use <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.bobek.compass/">this compass app</a> 
    and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapquest.android.ace">MapQuest</a> 
    for these two. However, MapQuest does have 2 known trackers, so an alternative 
    I'd recommend is <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.osmand.plus">OsmAnd</a>. 
    The issue I have with OsmAnd is when you want to use a specific address. 
    In many cases, I wasn't able to find the correct location using OsmAnd, and in 
    a few cases, it took me to a completely different area. But, all things considered, 
    MapQuest and OsmAnd are the top two GPS apps for me.
</p>
<p>
    Another utility is your keyboard. One thing you might not realize is that your 
    built-in keyboard is key logging everything you type, so for someone privacy 
    conscious, this is something to change.
</p>
<p>
    Simple Mobile Tools has a keyboard that you can use, which works just fine. 
    However, I prefer 
    <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.dslul.openboard.inputmethod.latin">OpenBoard</a>. 
    The layout simply suits me better. With this app, F-Droid has 
    <a href="https://search.f-droid.org/?q=keyboard&amp;page=1&amp;lang=en">a lot of options</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The last of the utility apps I can think of are password managers. The only 
    one that I would recommend is 
    <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.kunzisoft.keepass.libre/">KeePassDX</a>. 
    One of the biggest issues with password managers nowadays is that a lot of 
    them are saved to a cloud service, which means, if the service is attacked, 
    your login credentials are compromised. So one of the key features when looking 
    for a password manager is to make sure it is <strong>offline</strong>. This may 
    cause an inconvenience when switching between devices, sure, but it is way safer. 
    KeePassDX, in specific, is great due to how feature rich it is. Organizing passwords 
    and information is quite easy with KeePassDX, there's a built-in password generator, 
    it supports key files and hardware keys. Key files are essentially a second 
    password in the form of a file, and a hardware key is just that, a physical device 
    that is used as a key to the password manager. I use YubiKey for mine, however 
    there are a number on the market. Another interesting feature is the ability 
    to have multiple password databases, meaning you can have separate databases 
    depending on the passwords you want to store and each database can have a 
    different password/set of credentials to access it. The last thing is when 
    accessing an entry: there is the ability to auto-fill logins in apps or in 
    the browser, additionally there is a timed copy for credentials (i.e., you 
    have a certain amount of time before your copied credentials are cleared from 
    the clipboard and you have to copy them again). However, something that I 
    noticed, is the copied content can still be accessed if you tap on the "clipboard" 
    option when you long press.
</p>
<p>
    Other than these utilities, there are probably a number I am forgetting or 
    simply don't use. In this way, exploring for yourself, looking through what 
    F-Droid offers, can help you discover new apps.
</p>
<h4>App Launcher</h4>
<p>
    Another thing that might not come to mind is the App Launcher. For Samsung 
    users, you may have seen an app in settings called One UI Home, this is your 
    App Launcher from Samsung.
</p>
<p>
    You can change this launcher as well, since you're effectively being key 
    logged or "screen logged" by using the One UI Home.
</p>
<p>
    For this it basically comes down to aesthetic preference. Simple Mobile Tools 
    has their own app launcher, but it is too simple for my liking. Personally, 
    I use <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ch.deletescape.lawnchair.plah/">Lawnchair</a>, 
    but it all comes down to preferences and what your goal is.
</p>
<h4>VPN</h4>
<p>
    One of the best ways you can secure yourself and gain privacy on the internet 
    is to use a VPN. However, not every VPN was created equal.
</p>
<p>
    I would recommend using the 
    <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.mullvad.mullvadvpn/">Mullvad VPN</a>. 
    Like most VPN services, it is a paid service. The price for Mullvad VPN is €5/month 
    or $5.43/month, which is quite affordable. Mullvad VPN has a track record of 
    being transparent with how they handle user data and privacy. Their main point 
    is that they will keep your information private within the bounds of the law. 
    Meaning, if a warrant for your information is ordered, there's nothing they can 
    do, but other than that, they won't give your information to anyone for any reason.
</p>
<p>
    There is <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ch.protonvpn.android">ProtonVPN</a>, 
    which offers a free tier for their service, however whether privacy is 
    guaranteed, I'm not too sure. On their page they say: "We do not record your 
    browsing history; We do not display privacy-invading ads; We do not sell your 
    data to third parties; We do not limit how much you can download". However, 
    the amount of trust your willing to put into this is up to you. As a side 
    note, this is the same company that is responsible for Proton Mail that I 
    talked about in the Email section.
</p>
<h3>Going Forward</h3>
<p>
    This is a good start for privacy on Android. There are some things I didn't 
    cover, like social media alternatives, but this post is already long enough. 
    I strongly suggest looking at <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/">Privacy Tools</a> 
    to search for more information, additionally, looking at sites like 
    <a href="https://fossdroid.com/">fossdroid.com</a> and the 
    <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid store</a> are good areas to find open source
    and privacy focused applications. Remember, do your research, don't just take
    the app developers or the software's company — or even me — at their word.
