<h1>My Journey with React</h1>

    I want to say, early 2019, I was first introduced to React when my best friend (my roommate at the time)
    wanted to make a website for some reason. I believe it had to do with our math classes, 
    but I don't remember the specifics. At the time, though, I wasn't too interested, but that
    was mainly due to external factors like depression, loneliness, and other personal
    issues that affected my state of being.

<p>
    Fast forward to late 2019, in my sophomore year of college, I once again come back to React
    in the form of React Native. Again, my best friend (not my roommate at the time) asked if 
    I wanted to be a part of a team creating a "study-buddy" app modeled after Tinder.
    I said yes, and joined the team. The app is called KiwiLink, and it was made for 
    University of Washington (UW) students so they could find people to study with. One of 
    the jokes in the group was that we were gonna sell the app to UW and "make our millions", 
    that obviously didn't happen. This was my first real look at React and a more organized or 
    commercial use of programming. Development on this app continued for a few months, and
    we ended up releasing it on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, however, it 
    is no longer being maintained.

    Fast forward again to late 2020, and I have transferred to Central Washington University.
    This was also the year that COVID started, which was a great time to transfer, what with
    being at a completely new school, and all the classes being online. Despite that, I did
    well, and my mental health improved during this period, which is a big plus.
</p>
<p>
    After transferring, I picked up React once more in early 2021. 
    I had a class that was a software development class, specifically focused on the practical 
    application of the Agile development method. Our team decided on creating a Google Maps-like
    application for hiking trails in Washington. This was when I started to really like programming,
    as weird as that may seem, given I was already a CompSci major at that point. I think the 
    thing that was most satisfy was building parts that would be used multiple times (components)
    in our application, and seeing everything come together like a LEGO set.

    In the summer of that year, I was reached out to by my best friend again, and he
    simply asked if I wanted a job lol. When I said yes, I was reached out to by an 
    organization called Academics Are Cool that wanted to remake their website.
    This was what I like to call a big learning experience. It was my first extensive
    dive into website building, integration of different systems, databases, UX/UI, and a lot more.
    I worked on this project for the whole summer, and was finished with the user-facing part
    of the website, so it was essentially functional. I worked on this website on and off after this,
    only finishing the rest of it in summer of 2022, after I had graduated. One thing I wanted to
    note for myself is the fact that server-side code is a thing, because I didn't know about that 
    when I started the website, and I only found out about it after I had completed the website once 
    I started to actually learn about software development in general. But yeah, this was a 
    doozy of a project, and it didn't help that the organization basically ghosted me but didn't
    even use the website I made. At least I got the experience though.

    Aside from that, I used React for a number of other projects like the previous version of
    this website and the web version of the Pathfinding Algorithms simulation, also another class where
    we built a Spotify playlist generator and statistics viewer.

        const song = new Audio("funky-town-(low-quality)-made-with-Voicemod-technology.mp3");
        song.play();
    }
