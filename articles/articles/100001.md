# How to pick a first programming language.

#### By Ethan Krug

## Intro

If you are wanting to get into coding or computer science, it can be quite daunting picking a language to start in. With there being hundreds to thousands of different languages to pick from, it is understandable why people experience decision-making anxiety. I'm here to help alleviate this anxiety and give you reasons for choosing certain languages and their different quirks.

If I were to start over again, I would ask myself, "For what do I want to program for?" That one one question can narrow down the list significantly.

This may come as no surprise to many reading this, but Python is one of the best languages to learn for a beginner who can read English. 

Pythonâ€™s syntax can be read almost like a complete sentence. Look at this example below.

![Python Example](https://github.com/GurkNathe/Personal/blob/main/articles/media/first-lang-py.png?raw=true)

In this example, a list `L` is created where it contains the numbers 1 - 5.

Then, we have `number` set to the value 6. 

The `if-else` section reads as:

If the number is in the list: print 'The number is in the list!';

Else: print 'The number is NOT in the list!'

From the Python code above and the explaination, we can see it is very similar in syntax and readability to English.

While this is one of the main draws of Python for beginners, there are other benefits to the language.

For a beginner, programming concepts would most likely be foreign, so paradimes like Object Oriented Programming (OOP), or things like memory management and data typing wouldn't be baked in. 

One of the things Python offers is a loose typing constraint for its variables. For example, you can set a variable to a number, then set it to a list later on in the code without a type error. Some may see this as a negative to Python due to the possibility for negative side effects, but when first learning, it can be beneficial. Without strict typing, people can learn concepts in programming easier and quicker, without worrying whether they are using the correct datatype. In this way, loose typing is a good thing.

Another benefit is the popularity of the programming language. When a programming language is popular, there is generally greater support for it with many third-party contributors. Python can be found in many areas and used for many things. AI, Machine Learning, Data Science, Games, Website, Desktop Applications, etc. 

Another thing to note: if you want to get into data science, Python is one of the best languages to start with due to the large support and use of Python within that industry. Another language to explore if you are interesting in data science or statistics is the R language.

There are many uses for the language, so whatever you want to do with programming, you can probably do it in Python.
