<h1>Recipe: Kimchijeon (Kimchi Pancake)</h1>
<p>By Ethan Krug</p>

<p>
    When I was younger, I went over to one of my friend's house and his mother made us food. 
    One of the dishes was kimchijeon. I couldn't forget the taste of it, and wanted to try it 
    again. So, I made it myself.
</p>
<p>
    I did my research of the dish and came to know it is eaten as a side dish or a snack. 
    So, if you want a savory and delicious snack, this recipe is for you.
</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<p>
    You can eat this without a sauce, or with a sauce. I prefer it with a sauce, but 
    some of my family said it's better without the sauce. Just as a warning, this recipe 
    makes about five medium-size pancakes, so I'd suggest sharing with others or saving 
    some for later.

<h3>Pancake</h3>
<ul>
<li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1/2 cup potato starch</li>
<li>salt to taste</li>
<li>1/2 cup kimchi (chopped)</li>
<li>1 green onion/scallion (thick chopped)</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1/2 cup kimchi juice/other liquids</li>
<li>vegetable oil</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sauce</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
<li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon gochugaru/gochujang (for spice)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            (Pancake) In a large enough bowl, add your all-purpose flour and potato starch, 
            salt to taste. Combine until consistent throughout. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Then, add your kimchi, green onions/scallions, and eggs. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Then add the kimchi juice. The other liquids are optional, 
            and they can be basically anything: water, vinegar, etc. When I don't 
            have enough kimchi juice for the 1/2 cup, I usually make up the difference 
            with the other liquid. I'd suggest water, since you're probably not going 
            to get any issues with that, but you could use vinegar or even a stock of 
            some kind. But that would add a different flavor profile, so keep that in mind.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mix ingredients until thoroughly mixed. You can use chop sticks, a fork, or even 
            your hands (I'd wear cooking grade gloves) if you want.
        </p>
    </li>

            Next step is to cook the pancake. Get a large enough skillet
            and heat up your vegetable oil in it over medium high heat. You want to have a 
            good amount of oil on the skillet at all times of cooking for best results 
            (not drowning in it though). 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            When your oil is hot, place in 1/4 cup or smaller for 
            each pancake, depending on the size you want it. Spread the batter as thin as possible. 
            Cook until each side is lightly browned, roughly 3-5 minutes per side, or until 
            sufficiently cooked. Salt to taste and serve hot.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            (Sauce) In a bowl, mix together soy sauce, rice vinegar 
            (or another type of vinegar), sugar, sesame oil, and gochugaru/gochujang.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
    The batter can be made of basically whatever flour you have, however for my taste, 
    all-purpose flour with potato starch is what I prefer. You can also buy a Korean flour mix, 
    however the all-purpose flour and potato starch is more accessible in America, and quite a 
    bit cheaper. You could also skip the potato starch, but the pancake won't be as crunchy.
</p>
<p>
    For the vinegar mentioned in this recipe, personally, I could interchange it with 
    white vinegar, however that adds more of a bite, which some might not like.
</p>
<p>
    When cooking the pancakes, try keeping oil on the surface that is in direct contact with 
    the pancake for best results. It may seem like a lot of oil, but it makes for a better end 
    result. I usually lift the pancake up while it is cooking and push the oil on the pan under it.
</p>
<p>
    For the skillet, I would strongly recommend using an electric skillet or a skillet with 
    a large surface area. If you use a smaller pan, it will take significantly longer to 
    cook all the batter, which I found out the first time, and some of the pancakes were 
    lukewarm by the time everything was cooked. With a large cook surface, you can cook 
    multiple pancakes at once.
